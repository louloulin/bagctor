# Bactor Development Plan

## Current Implementation

### Core Features

1. **Actor Base Model**
   - Actor base class with behavior management and message handling
   - Multiple actor creation patterns:
     - Class-based (fromClass)
     - Function-based (fromProducer)
     - Lambda-style (fromHandler)
     - Stateful (fromState)
     - Context-aware (fromFunc)

2. **Message Passing System**
   - Basic message passing mechanism
   - Asynchronous message processing
   - Basic Mailbox implementation

3. **Remote Communication**
   - gRPC-based remote actor communication
   - Remote actor creation, message sending, and termination
   - Basic monitoring mechanism

## Missing Features (Compared to Proto.Actor Standard)

1. **Supervision System**
   - Complete supervision hierarchy
   - Failure handling strategies:
     - Resume (continue with state)
     - Restart (reset state)
     - Stop
     - Escalate

2. **Actor Lifecycle Management**
   - Complete implementation of lifecycle hooks:
     - preStart()
     - postStop()
     - preRestart()
     - postRestart()

3. **State Persistence**
   - Message persistence mechanism
   - State recovery mechanism
   - State replay during failure recovery

4. **Location Transparency**
   - Complete PID (Process ID) routing system
   - Cross-node transparent message passing
   - Cluster support

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Enhancement
- [ ] Implement complete supervision system
- [ ] Enhance actor lifecycle management
- [ ] Improve error handling mechanism

#### Supervision System Implementation
```typescript
class SupervisorStrategy {
  abstract handleFailure(
    supervisor: ActorContext,
    child: PID,
    error: Error
  ): SupervisorDirective;
}

enum SupervisorDirective {
  Resume,
  Restart,
  Stop,
  Escalate
}
```

### Phase 2: Reliability Enhancement
- [ ] Implement message persistence
- [ ] Add state recovery mechanism
- [ ] Complete failure recovery strategies

#### State Persistence Implementation
```typescript
interface Persistence {
  persist(event: any): Promise<void>;
  recover(): Promise<void>;
}

class PersistentActor extends Actor implements Persistence {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### Phase 3: Distributed Support
- [ ] Enhance remote communication capabilities
- [ ] Implement cluster support
- [ ] Perfect location transparency

#### Cluster Support Implementation
```typescript
interface ClusterConfig {
  nodes: string[];
  strategy: PlacementStrategy;
}

class ClusterActorSystem extends ActorSystem {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize message passing performance
- [ ] Implement message priorities
- [ ] Add custom Mailbox support

## Development Guidelines

1. **Priority Order**
   - Follow the phase order strictly
   - Ensure stability of each phase before moving to the next
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for each new feature
   - Integration tests for system components
   - Performance benchmarks for optimizations

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation for each new feature
   - Usage examples and best practices
   - Architecture diagrams for complex features

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Infrastructure Enhancement (4 weeks)
- Phase 2: Reliability Enhancement (4 weeks)
- Phase 3: Distributed Support (6 weeks)
- Phase 4: Performance Optimization (4 weeks)

Total estimated time: 18 weeks

Note: Timeline is tentative and may be adjusted based on development progress and priorities.
