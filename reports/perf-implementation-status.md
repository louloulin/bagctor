# Performance Optimization Implementation Status

## Implemented Optimizations

### Phase 1: Basic Optimizations

#### ✅ Behavior Caching in Actor Class
- The Actor class already includes an optimized implementation with behavior caching
- Using `cachedBehavior` and `cachedBehaviorState` to avoid repeated lookups in `behaviorMap`
- Pre-binding `this` context for better performance

#### ✅ Mailbox Processing Optimization
- Improved the `DefaultMailbox.scheduleProcessing` method to use `queueMicrotask` instead of creating new Promises
- Implemented batch processing with the `processNextBatch` method
- Added proper handling of system and user messages with prioritization
- Created `invoke` unification method to streamline message handling

#### ✅ ThreadPool Dispatcher Enhancements
- Added comprehensive metrics tracking for tasks including latency, wait times, and utilization
- Implemented optimal worker selection based on load and queue length
- Added adaptive scheduling that adjusts concurrency levels based on performance metrics
- Improved error handling and task completion notification

### Phase 2: Structural Optimizations

#### ✅ Actor Pool Implementation
- Implemented `ActorPool` class for efficient actor instance reuse
- Added methods for acquiring and releasing actors from the pool
- Added proper actor state reset for reuse
- Included pool statistics for monitoring and optimization

#### ✅ Message Batch Processing
- Enhanced `sendBatchLocal` method to process large batches in parallel
- Optimized `sendBatchRemote` with fallback mechanism for client implementations without batch support
- Added prioritization for system messages in batch processing
- Implemented chunked processing with controlled parallelism for better resource utilization

#### ✅ Router Optimizations for Efficient Message Distribution
- Implemented optimized routing strategies with reduced mutex overhead
- Added fast paths for common routing scenarios (single routee, small routee sets)
- Improved consistent hash routing with binary search and hash caching
- Optimized weighted round-robin with pre-computed selection plans
- Reduced object creation and unnecessary logging in production environments

## Pending Optimizations

### Phase 3: Architectural Optimizations
- [ ] Message Processing Pipeline refactoring
- [ ] Lock-free concurrent structures
- [ ] Multi-layered dispatch strategies

## Performance Improvements

Based on the implemented optimizations, we expect the following performance improvements:

1. **Mailbox Processing**: 50% reduction in scheduling overhead, improved concurrency
2. **Actor Behavior Dispatch**: 30-50% faster message processing, reduced lookup overhead
3. **Thread Pool Management**: 2-3x improved CPU utilization, better parallelism
4. **Actor Reuse**: 5-10x better performance for temporary actors, reduced GC pressure
5. **Batch Message Processing**: 3-5x improved throughput for broadcast messages and multi-target communication
6. **Router Performance**: 2-4x faster message routing with reduced contention and optimized strategies

## Next Steps

1. Conduct comprehensive performance testing to measure actual gains
2. Refine adaptive scheduling parameters based on real-world usage
3. Begin planning for Phase 3 optimizations
